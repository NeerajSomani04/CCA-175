Below are the points one should remember Exam Day:

a) Need to check first about python version and make proper environment settings to update and use python 3.x version. 

b) you need to make sure about ip addresses and port number for differenet services running on CDH multinode cluster. 
      In exam cluster mysql and hdfs could be at different node. means different servers (ip-addresses).
      
c) Open 4 applications on CDH:
    1) Sublim / any other text editor
    2) Cloudera Manager
    3) Terminal 
        a) for Hive
        b) for pyspark --> 2 terminal to work on 2 problems simultaneously. This is because code usually takes long time to run.
        c) for mysql
        d) sqoop
        e) need to update from here if needed for flume/impala/
