Below are the points one should remember Exam Day:

a) Need to check first about python version and make proper environment settings to update and use python 3.x version. 

b) you need to make sure about ip addresses and port number for differenet services running on CDH multinode cluster. 
      In exam cluster mysql and hdfs could be at different node. means different servers (ip-addresses).
      
c) Open 4 applications on CDH:
    1) Sublim / any other text editor
    2) Cloudera Manager
    3) Terminal 
        a) for Hive
        b) for pyspark --> 2 terminal to work on 2 problems simultaneously. This is because code usually takes long time to run.
        c) for mysql
        d) sqoop
        e) need to update from here if needed for flume/impala/
        
d) There should be some UI in cloudera that provides information about Namenode. NameNode will give us information about many important components. Need to locate and understand core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, yarn-site.xml, spark-env.sh

e) understand memory and cluster capacity will help to leverage cluster properly and run jobs in proper manner. This way we can execute jobs fast and save some time in exam.

f) At time of certification, cloudera wouldn't allow us to connect to mysql. we need to validate any mysql queries through sqoop.
