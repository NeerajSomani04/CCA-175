sbt --> Simple Build tool
Maven --> is also SBT. It is to solve dependencies.

IDE --> Integrated Development Environment

Scala and Spark Live training - 02 - Overview of setting up environment and REPL

Basics of Scala --
val is immutable
var is mutable

Tasks: 
create val a that is an integer value 42 --> val a = 42
create val b that is a long value 42 --> val b: Long = 42L
create val c that is a float value 42.0 --> val c: Float = 42.0f
create val d that is a double value as multiplication of a, b, c --> val d: Double  = a * b * c
create val e that is a short value 42.0 --> val e: Short = 42
create val f that is a byte value 42.0 --> val f: Byte = 42
create val g that is a hex of number (42) in base 10 --> val g = 0x42 (result will print always in Int format because of OS)
