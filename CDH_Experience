Below are few things that I want to note down as part of my Cloudera Quickstart VM 5.12.0.0 experience:

1) It comes with Eclipse IDE only.
        have to use CDI or some text editor.
2) It comes by default with Python 2.6.6
    Below are steps how I installed python 3.x version using Anaconda. The best way to install Python needed version is using 
    Cloudra Manager parcels tool. This you can find in below link. you can also do this with CLI but its a lot of hassel and CDH Admin 
    usually do that so we don't need to understand as part of this certification learning.
    
    Below are the articles, I followed to install python 3.x:
        https://danieleriksson.net/2017/02/08/how-to-install-latest-python-on-centos/
    
    Below steps that used to install python 3.6.x
        # Start by making sure your system is up-to-date:
        yum update
        # Compilers and related tools:
        yum groupinstall -y "development tools"
        # Libraries needed during compilation to enable all features of Python:
        yum install -y zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel readline-devel tk-devel gdbm-devel db4-devel libpcap-devel xz-devel expat-devel
        # If you are on a clean "minimal" install of CentOS you also need the wget tool:
        yum install -y wget
        # Below to download anaconda
        wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
        # Below to install anaconda
        bash Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
        # conda is added to by bash file. Need to activate it now in environment.
        source ~/.bashrc
        # conda is install now. Verify by below. It will list all packages installed.
        conda list
   
    few articles:
    1) for installing jupyter notebook for python 2.6
    http://www.jbencina.com/blog/2017/04/08/installing-jupyter-notebook-cloudera-quickstart-vm/
    2) set up python 2.7 or 3.3.3 on centOS 6.4
    https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-python-2-7-6-and-3-3-3-on-centos-6-4
    3) Anaconda blog for CDH
     https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/cloudera
    4) go to point where mentioned about Install and maintain python environment and follow till end.
      https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-5-x/topics/spark_python.html
    
    Once python and conda all set.
    # Run below command to verify python interpreter working fine.
    python  #this is prompt to python env
    print('hello world') #this command will print hello world
    
    If you run the program through .py file make sure to specify location of the Python interpreter. For example:
    #! usr/bin/local
    # in my case it is #!/home/cloudera/anaconda3/bin/python
