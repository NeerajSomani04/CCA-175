Lecture 13:-

1) we have selected Oregon region because many new services available there.
2) Create first key pair pem file and downloaded/placed at itversity lab location "/home/dkothari/aws_practice/Oregon_First.pem"
    i) after downloading pem file, I used vi editor to copy and paste content of pem file to itveristy lab location.
3) Create first default instance with all default settings.
4) Need to connect to this instance using public IP address and private Key pair file (Oregon_First.pem)
    i) not able to connect to EC2 instances using Private IP address without VPN machines.
5) changed permission of the file --> chmod 400 Oregon_First.pem

6) Below is the command to connect to EC2 instances using ssh.
  ssh -i "/home/dkothari/aws_practice/Oregon_First.pem" ec2-user@54.191.225.94
  
7) Firwall -- Security groups 
    Firwall allows only authenticate users. 
    
8) Two Device type for instances
  i) Instance stores: Its a temporary block storage. Data will be removed from hard disk once you stop instances.
  ii) EBS Portal HardDisk: EBS (Elastic Block Storage).
    Its a permanent block storage, means even if we start or stop instances the data in the hard disk will not be lost.
    Its High avalability and scalability is the key, dynamic increase in capacity and performance and replicate in availability zone.
    
9) Compute != Storage
    EC2 --> RAM and CPU
    AWS EC2 generally regarded as compute based service and compute generally refer to Memory and CPU.
    EC2 and EBS are two seperate services in AWS.

10) ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) -->
  This automatically allows incoming traffic to distribute across multiple instances.
  It can handle rapid change in network traffic pattern
