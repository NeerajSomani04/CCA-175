Lecture 13:-

1) we have selected Oregon region because many new services available there.
2) Create first key pair pem file and downloaded/placed at itversity lab location "/home/dkothari/aws_practice/Oregon_First.pem"
    i) after downloading pem file, I used vi editor to copy and paste content of pem file to itveristy lab location.
3) Create first default instance with all default settings.
4) Need to connect to this instance using public IP address and private Key pair file (Oregon_First.pem)
    i) not able to connect to EC2 instances using Private IP address without VPN machines.
5) changed permission of the file --> chmod 400 Oregon_First.pem

6) Below is the command to connect to EC2 instances using ssh.
  ssh -i "/home/dkothari/aws_practice/Oregon_First.pem" ec2-user@54.191.225.94
  
7) Firwall -- Security groups 
    Firwall allows only authenticate users. 
    
8) Two Device type for instances
  i) Instance stores: Its a temporary block storage. Data will be removed from hard disk once you stop instances.
  ii) EBS Portal HardDisk: EBS (Elastic Block Storage).
    Its a permanent block storage, means even if we start or stop instances the data in the hard disk will not be lost.
    Its High avalability and scalability is the key, dynamic increase in capacity and performance and replicate in availability zone.
    
9) Compute != Storage
    EC2 --> RAM and CPU
    AWS EC2 generally regarded as compute based service and compute generally refer to Memory and CPU.
    EC2 and EBS are two seperate services in AWS.

10) ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) -->
  This automatically allows incoming traffic to distribute across multiple instances.
  It can handle rapid change in network traffic pattern
  
11) Scaling to Traffic pattern -->
    Define rule based on which AWS will automatically allocate server instances to the traffic.

12) AWS S3 --> Unlimited Storage, S3 (Simple Storage Service)
    few of the features that comes by default with AWS S3 -->
    Versioning, Encryption, Logging, Transfer Acceleration, Cross Region Replication

Two important Terminologies of S3:
Buckets --> Its like folder where data resides. Bucket name should be unique, as it shared across all users.
Objects --> its just files like image files, or text files.


13) S3 storage classes: mostly these differce in pricing, availability, durability, performance
General Purpose --> Standard S3
Infrequent Access --> Standard S3 IA
RRS --> Reduce Redundency Storage 
Archive --> Glaciar (mostly used ofr long time back-up). User can't directly upload files to this storage. User has to first upload file in any of the above 3 storage classes and then move to Archive or Glacier storage class.

14) S3 Life cycle policies:
    in this we create lifecycle events -->
    i) like after 90 days move files from Standard S3 to Standard IA and after 365 days move to Glcier.
15) Databases:
