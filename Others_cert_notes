1) Work on multiple problems together
2) File formats, transformations and join these are most important topics for exam.

tmuralikrishna -- Cleared CCA175 - 05FEB2018
1) 2 sqoop(import & export) questions & 7 spark.
2) Focus more on compression techniques.
3) Just for exam do not spend lot of time on spark streaming.
4) Keep last 15 minutes just for checking output location and see if the format and compression are correct.
5) size of the datasets are very small that default spark-shell options worked quick enough for me.

1) do not worry if you know all the concepts in Druga Sir’s videos/exercises and 
you can finish the mock questions in Arun’s blog in time and accurate, you are good to go.
2) better to have a big monitor for the exam. 
3) pay attention to the output requirements. (location, file format, file content, compression, record count…)
4) if you have enough time, you can use both HDFS commands and Spark-shell to check/reverse check your output.

Dinakar -- Cleared CCA 175 19-Dec-2017

1) For Sqoop try and memorize as much as possible all the commands in import and export and how and where to use them.
2) Be well acquainted with the file format conversion from one format to other.
3) One should remember how to covert and store the data in a specified location.
4) Get well versed with RDD’s transformations and actions. Data frames for saving and generating desired output using SQL.
5) One should know how to convert from RDD to DF and vice versa.
6) SQL’s are simple not very difficult. A practice of simple SQL and joins will suffice. Need to know join RDD / Data frames.
