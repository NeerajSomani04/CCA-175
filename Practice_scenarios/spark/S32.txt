Problem Scenario 32 : You have given three files as below. 
spark3/sparkdir1/file1 .txt 
spark3/sparkdir2/file2.txt 
spark3/sparkdir3/file3.txt 
Each file contain some text. As given in RHS (Righ hand side). 
Now write a Spark code in scala which will load all these three files from hdfs and do the word count by filtering following words. 
And result should be sorted by word count in reverse order. 
Filter words (“a”,”the”,”an”, “as”, “a”,  “with”, “this”, “this”, “these”, “is”, “are”, “in”, “for”, “to”, “and”, “the”, “of” 
Also please make sure you load all three files as a Single RDD (All three files must be loaded using single API call). 
You have also been given following codec 
import org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.GzipCodec 
Please use above codec to compress file, while saving in hdfs. 


Solution:
I have created files under below location with some text.
/user/dkothari/practice_scenarios/S32

val fileRDD = sc.textFile("/user/dkothari/practice_scenarios/S32/sparkdir1/file1.txt,/user/dkothari/practice_scenarios/S32/sparkdir2/file2.txt,/user/dkothari/practice_scenarios/S32/sparkdir3/file3.txt")
val fileMap = fileRDD.flatMap( x => (x.split(" "))).map( x => (x.toLowerCase.trim))

val FilterList = List("a","the","an", "as", "with", "this","these", "is", "are", "in", "for", "to", "and", "of")
val filterRDD = sc.parallelize(FilterList)


val finalWords = fileMap.subtract(filterRDD)
val finalRDD = finalWords.map( x => (x,1))
val finalRbyK = finalRDD.reduceByKey( (total, next) => (total + next))
val Result = finalRbyK.sortBy( x => x._2, false)

import org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.GzipCodec 
Result.saveAsTextFile("/user/dkothari/practice_scenarios/S32/Result", classOf[org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.GzipCodec])


//alternative approach for sorting
val finalSwap = finalRbyK.map( x => x.swap)
val sortResult = finalSwap.sortByKey(false)
