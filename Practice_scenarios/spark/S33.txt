Problem Scenario 33 : You have given a files as below. 
spark5/EmployeeName.csv (id,name) 
spark5/EmployeeSalary.csv (id,salary) 
Data is given in RHS (Righ hand side). 
Now write a Spark code in scala which will load these two files from hdfs and join the same, and produce the (name,salary) values. 
And save the data in multiple file group by salary (Means each file will have name of employees with same salary). 
Make sure file name includes salary as well.

Solution:

loaded data in below folder location:
/user/dkothari/practice_scenarios/S33/

val ENameRDD = sc.textFile("/user/dkothari/practice_scenarios/S33/EmployeeName.csv")
val ENameMap = ENameRDD.map(x => (x.split(",")(0).toInt, x.split(",")(1)))
val ESalaryRDD = sc.textFile("/user/dkothari/practice_scenarios/S33/EmployeeSalary.csv")
val ESalaryMap = ESalaryRDD.map(x => (x.split(",")(0).toInt, x.split(",")(1).toFloat))

val joinRDD = ENameMap.join(ESalaryMap)
val joinMap = joinRDD.map(x => x._2)
val joinGBy = joinMap.groupBy( x => x._2)

val result = joinGBy.map{case (k,v) => k->sc.makeRDD(v.toSeq)}
