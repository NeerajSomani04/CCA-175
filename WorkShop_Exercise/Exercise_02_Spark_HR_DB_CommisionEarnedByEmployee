Description

Intention of this problem is to understand the process of developing applications
Dependencies: MySQL JDBC, typesafe.config for externalizing JDBC URL
Use MySQL as database. If you do not have one, install it locally.
Steps to setup database
Create database by name HR
Switch to HR database
Run this script, it will create bunch of tables
Get it from github53
List the tables
Make sure employees table is in the list
Understand all the columns
Also there is database by name hr in lab, user name hr_ro, password itversity. You can connect to it as well, instead of setting up database locally
Use best programming practices, than trying to do every thing using scala (for eg, if you write sql try to get as much work as possible done in sql it self)
Problem Statement

Let us get commission earned by each and every employee
For each and every employee who have commission_pct set compute commission earned in dollars (by multiplying salary with commission_pct)
Print employee name, salary and commission earned
If commission_pct is null in database, print “N/E” for commission earned
