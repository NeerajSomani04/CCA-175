Description

We will be creating several hive tables using different file formats, delimiters and partitioning strategy
Also we will be loading data into these hive tables
Data Location
HDFS - /public/retail_db
Local - /data/retail_db
To get data types visit mysql database retail_db using user retail_dba
Problem Statement

Make sure you have 2 databases with your OS User name and then stage and final as suffix
example: dgadiraju_stage, dgadiraju_final
dgadiraju_stage - Create external tables in dgadiraju_stage pointing to HDFS location /public/retail_db
dgadiraju_stage - Make sure at least one table point to different location and use load command to load data from local file system into the hive table
dgadiraju_final - Create all 6 tables in hive as managed tables, delimiter is “|”, also use gzip compression while storing the data
Also create 2 additional tables for orders and order_items where both tables are bucketed by order_id
Create another table for orders where data is partitioned by order_month
