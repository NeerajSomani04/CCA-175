Change the block size to 64 MB
Change replication factor to 1
Get the metadata of the files (hdfs fsck)
Also, answer these questions

What is default block size? What is the purpose of block size?
What is default replication factor? Explain the purpose of replication factor
Make sure you understand the role of name node/secondary name node and data node
What are different commands to copy files from local filesystem on Gateway node to HDFS?
What are different commands to copy files from HDFS to local filesystem on Gateway node?
