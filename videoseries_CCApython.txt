video 01 Python Fundamentals - Introduction (for Spark)

python doesn't compile code but its an interprer based programming language. 
REPL --> READ, EVALUATE, PRINT and LOOP

exit() or Ctrl+D is used to come out of python prompt
ctrl+l --> to clear the screen

video 02 - Python basic programming constructs (decalring variables, invoking functions)
how to write function and for loop, while loop was discussed

03 Python Fundamentals - Functions and lambda functions

below is sample function that shows how can we yuse lambda function:

def sum(func, lb, ub):
  total = 0
  while(lb <= ub):
    total += func(lb)
    lb += 1
  return total

to use this function now we can run below commands with lambda or even with any other function:

sum(lambda i: i * i, 1, 10) --> this will print the sum of squares

04 Python Fundamentals - Collections (list, set, dictionary, tuple)

list --> mutable, can have duplicate values, also values are in ordered format
set --> mutable, no duplicate, order of values is not confirmed
tuple --> immutable, can have duplicate, ordered values
dictionary --> mutable, key-value pair format, key should be unique across dictionary

help(list) or help(set) , etc commands can be used to get the available list of APIs like append

list123.append('test') --> this command will append 'test' value in list123 list
list123.pop('test') --> is used to delete 'test' value
set123.add('test') --> this command will add 'test' value in set123 set

index, count, intersection, union, difference are few other important APIs that we should be aware of.

list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
list[1:4] will print --> [2, 3, 4]
list[-1] will print --> [8]

dictionary --> key - value pair form
dict = {'1':'value1', '2':'value2'}

dict.keys() -->  this command will only return key of dictionary collection
dict.values() --> will return only values
dict.items() --> will return key-value pair in the form of tuple

has_key, get are few other API functions that can be used with dictionary

05 Python Fundamentals - Map, filter and Reduce APIs 
map --> this API is used to perform the trasformation on each element of each row
filter --> this API is used to perform any filteration of data set
reduce --> this API is used to perform the aggregation activity on dataset

below is one example for these API:
l = list(range(1,100)) --> this will create a list of element from 1 to 99

f = list(filter(lambda i: i%2 ==0, l)) --> using this f list will contain only even elements, means from 2 to 98 even numbers
m = list(map(lambda i: i * i, f)) --> will return list of square of each element
from functools import reduce
r = reduce(lambda total, element: total + element, m)

06 Scala or Python - Setup Data Set for basic I/O operations 
this video is to download dataset from github 

on lab all data-sets are available at path -- /data/retail_db

07 Python Fundamentals - IO Operations and processing data from files

to navigate to directory --> cd /data/retail_db/order_items

tail part-00000 ---> this command is used to see few records of file

below command to open the file and read records of the file in python shell -->

OrderItemsFile = open("/data/retail_db/order_items/part-00000", "r") --> this will return file object
OrderItemsRead = OrderItemsFile.read() --> this will return a str (string object)
OrderItems = OrderItemsRead.splitlines() --> this will return list object and we can perform all list operations
len(OrderItems] --> this will provide me number of records in file
OrderItems[-10:-1] --> this will return last 10 records from the list

Now we can perform any list operations on this. for example, map, reduce, filter

OrderItemsFilter = list(filter(lambda rec: int(rec.split(",")[1]) == 68880, OrderItems))
