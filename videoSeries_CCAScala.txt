Video 01 - Scala Fundamentals --> Have instructions on scala setup on mac with intellij IDE
Video 02 - Basic Scala Programming --> Var, val, loops
Video 03 - Functions --> definiing functions and anaonymous funcs.
Video 04 - OOPs concepts --> Class
     below command is used to set Java_Home environment path, so that we can use :javap command of scala.
        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk
    Few Important points for Scala Class:
       Scala Class defination by default generate default constructor.
       If there is any argumnet of class with Val or Var, then those will be only argument of class and not variable of class.
       If arguments are defined by Val (immutable), getter method will be available by constructor.
       If arguments are defined by Var (mutable), getter and setter method will be available by constructor.
Video 05 - OOPs concepts --> Objects
       Objects are singleton class, hence it can not be intitable more than once. 
       There is no constructor for Objects.
       Companion Objects:- Class name and Object name are same.
Video 06 - OOPs concepts --> Case Classes
      This basically gives you many functionality as a inbuilt, without writting much code.
Video 07 - Scala Fundamentals --> Collection
      Sequence --> hold number of elements
          Array -->
          List -->
      Set --> unique values
      Map --> (Key,value) pair
