     below command is used to set Java_Home environment path, so that we can use :javap command of scala.
        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk
    Few Important points for Scala Class:
       Scala Class defination by default generate default constructor.
       If there is any argumnet of class with Val or Var, then those will be only argument of class and not variable of class.
       If arguments are defined by Val (immutable), getter method will be available by constructor.
       If arguments are defined by Var (mutable), getter and setter method will be available by constructor.
